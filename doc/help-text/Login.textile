To use ONEIS with your personal account, click on the "Log in" link and enter your email address and password.

If your username and password are not recognised make sure you are typing them in correctly and check your Caps lock isn't on. For a password reminder use the "Forgotten your password?" link on the login page.

When your ONEIS account was created, you will have been sent a link to set your password. Your password must contain at least eight characters,  including at least one letter and one number. 

To avoid having to type in your username and password each time you login, check the "In future, automatically log in on this computer" box. For security, *do not check this box* on public terminals or if others use your computer, as anyone else using this computer will be able to use your ONEIS account without having to enter the password.
