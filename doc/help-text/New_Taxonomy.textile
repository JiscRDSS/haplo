h1. New taxonomy

Taxonomies should be created sparingly, as using too many could confuse when describing items.

h3. Taxonomy name

Use a short name for the taxonomy. This will be used as the top level term of the taxonomy in the user interface, such as Browse and the item editor, but this highest level term can't be used to describe an item.

h3. Type

You can have more than one type of taxonomy. When setting up an taxonomy attribute, you choose which of the taxonomy types the attribute will use. By having multiple taxonomy types, you can use different sets of taxonomies in different attributes.

For flexibility, tend towards creating a new type for each taxonomy, unless the taxonomies are definitely related.

If you create a new type and attribute pair, you will need to add this attribute to other types before you can use it to describe items.

h2. Editing your taxonomy

The automatic taxonomy creation sets up a type and attribute. You can edit any of these using the normal type, attribute editors in System Management.
