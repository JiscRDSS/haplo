h1. Search subsets

Search subsets enable users to search within a pre-defined subset of sections. The subsets appear in the _Search in_ drop down menu on the main search screen. 

A search subset will only be offered to a user if they have search permission within at least one of the sections. Even if a section is within the selected search subset, it will only be searched if the user has permission.

Therefore, you can create an _Everything_ search subset which contains all the sections. Any user can select it, and they will search everything that they have permission to search.

h2. Managing search subsets

To edit a search subset:

* choose the search subset
* choose _Edit_ in the right hand panel.

To set the order in which the subsets appear in the _Search in_ drop down menu, click _Set subset order_.

To create a new search subset, click _New search subset_.
