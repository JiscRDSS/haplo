h1. Contact relationship management

People and organisations are stored separately, but linked together to show which person works for which organisation. 

Before adding a new organisation record, check it doesn't already exist in the system by searching for the organisation name.

Add the organisation record first:
* go to _Add_
* choose _Organisation_
* describe the organisation using the fields displayed
* _Save_.

Then add the people records:
* go to the record of the organisation they work for
* click on _Contact_ (top right of screen) and choose _Add Person_ 
* add the details of the person you know who works for that organisation
* repeat for each person you know working for that organisation
* there's no need to add the address for each person if it's the same as the organisation they work for. 

Adding people who aren't linked to an organisation:
* go to _Add_
* choose _Person_
* fill in the details of the person
* _Save_.
