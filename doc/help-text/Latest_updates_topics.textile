h1. Latest updates topics

The latest updates service alerts users to new items that may be of interest to them by email bulletins. 

Topics should be set on a per group basis wherever possible, although it is possible set it on an individual basis. 

Latest updates can be on types, subjects or any object. 

* choose the type, subject or object to be included in the latest updates
* the topic will now appear in the menu at the top of the page
* choose the setting for this topic:
** offer: the user can choose to subscribe
** default: the user can choose to unsubscribe 
** force: the user cannot unsubscribe.

h2. Recommendation

Latest update topics should be set on groups, rather than on the individual users. If you name the groups by purpose or function, this makes management of settings much easier.
