h1. Latest updates settings

Latest updates are the automatic email bulletins sent by ONEIS to users showing them recent items of interest added to the system. 

Settings should be made on a per group basis wherever possible, though settings can be made on an individual basis. Settings on an individual user's account override those made on a group basis. 

* _Send emails_: choose the frequency with which latest updates emails are sent (or choose to never send emails.)
* _Email format_: choose plain or formatted.

h2. Email template

Choose the email template for your latest updates emails. 

Choosing to _use setting from parent group_ uses the parent group's email template setting by default, where this group is a member of another group. 

Templates can be created or amended using [[Email templates]]. You can apply different templates to different groups; for example, your staff could receive an internal newsletter, but your clients receive a branded news service.

h2. Remove settings

_Reset to defaults_ sets this user or group to use the defaults set on the parent group.

h2. Recommendation

Latest update settings should be set on groups, rather than on the individual users. If you name the groups by purpose or function, this makes management of settings much easier.
