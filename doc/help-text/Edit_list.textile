h1. Edit list

This page shows the names of the Attribute and Object type which make up this lists, along with the objects which form the entries in the list.

h2. Add choice objects

The Choice objects form the entries of the list, and are created in the special _classification_ section. They are normal objects, and have their own page which will list everything linked to them, forming a list of the objects described by this choice.

To add new choices, fill in the Title (which will be the entry in the drop down list in the editor) and any alternative titles for use in searching.

Click _Quick add_ to quickly add the object.

h2. Edit entries

You can edit the choice objects by clicking the _edit_ links next to the name. The editor will pop up in a new window. If you have defined extra attributes for your classification type, they'll be editable here.

Additional alternative titles can be added by clicking the + to the left of title and choosing _Alternative_ from the qualifiers drop down menu. 

h2. Deleting entries

Use the _del_ button to delete a choice object. You can only delete a choice if no object in the system is described with it.
