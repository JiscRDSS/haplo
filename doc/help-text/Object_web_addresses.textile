h1. Edit URL slug length

'Slugs' are the text automatically appended to object web addresses (URLs) based on the object's title. When you email a URL to a colleague, they will have an idea of what they'll see before they click on it.

The slug should be long enough to give a description of the object, but not so long that the URL becomes unwieldy. 

The default slug length of 32 is recommended.

Set to 0 to disable slugs.
