h1. Navigation

The navigation links on the left of each page are divided into groups by separators. The first link in each group is used as the heading, and shown in bold.

This navigation editor allows you to choose which links are displayed to members of specified groups, and in which order they appear.


h2. Separators

Separators divide up the links. If there are no links visible between separators, then nothing is displayed.

If _Collapse group below_ is checked, then the entries below will only be displayed if one of the links is selected. This creates a more compact display.

Click _Add separator_ to add a new separator to the navigation.


h2. Objects

You can add a link to an object in the system, using the _Add object_ button. This lists all the entries in the Tray. You can also use this button to open a new window to find the required object.

The object will only be displayed if the user has permission to read it, regardless of the group you choose.


h2. Links

As an advanced option, you can also add links to any page in the system. Links must begin with '/'.

Click _Add link_ to add a link.
