h1. Hierarchy

PRODUCT_NAME supports two kinds of hierarchical items:

* Classification, as taxonomies for describing items
* Parent/child relationships between items

h2. Classification hierarchy

Select the _classification_ and _hierarchy_ behaviours when defining the types.

Create an attribute which links to objects of this type. It will use the hierarchical UI in the editor.

Create a new taxonomy based on this type by choosing TOOLS then Manage taxonomies. This taxonomy will then appear in the BROWSE list.

h2. Parent/child relationships

For parent/child relationships in items,

* Select the _hierarchy_ behaviour
* Add the _Parent_ attribute, or an alias

This will allow the user to specify the parent of an object, which must be of the same type.
