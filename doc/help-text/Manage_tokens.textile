h1. Manage tokens

Authentication tokens provide an extra level of security. This page lists all the users, and any tokens issued to them.

It is important that you manage tokens carefully to avoid compromising the security of the system.

h2. Issue token

To issue a token, click 'Issue' next to the user. Type in the token serial number and the current code from the token.

h2. Replace token

If you're asked to replace a token, be very careful that you're issuing the replacement to the correct person.

h2. Withdraw token

Withdrawing a token will, depending on the configuration of the system, either prevent a user from logging in, or allow the user to log in without a token.

h2. Create temporary code

If a user has forgotten a token, you can create a temporary code to allow them to log in. Make sure you verify the identity of the user carefully.
