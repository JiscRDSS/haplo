h1. Permissions

*Policies* are overall statements of what a user can do in the system. These are settings which don't relate to objects.

*Permissions* control whether users can view and edit objects.

Policies and Permissions should be set on a group basis. Although you can set permissions on individual users, it is recommended you only do this in exceptional circumstances. Defining permissions by role rather than by individuals simplifies administration. 

Users can belong to more than one group. Policies for a user are calculated by using all the settings for all the groups they belong to. All the Allows are summed together, then all the Denies are summed together. If a user has an Allow but not a Deny, then they are given that policy.

When completing the tables there is no need to specify an allow or deny for each line. If membership of a group does not affect policy, leave both the Allow and Deny boxes unchecked. Check the Allow box only if users are allowed to view it, and the Deny box only if they are definitely not allowed. 

In general you should try and just use the Allow box. Using too many Denies becomes very confusing and make future changes more difficult. Deny is mainly useful for setting up anonymous access (without a login) to the system, where you would explicitly deny access to virtually everything.
