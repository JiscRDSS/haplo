h1. Lists

Use _Lists_ to offer drop down menus of choices in the object editor.

Lists are constructed from:

* A classification _type_ for the 'choice objects'.
* Objects of this type, which are usually created in the special _classification_ section. Apart from this, the choice objects are completely normal objects in the system.
* An _attribute_ which has a data type of "link to object", and is set to link to objects of the classification type.

This list editor is a convenient way of setting up the type and attribute, and then creating the objects in the classification section.

After creating a list and adding some choice objects, add the attribute to the Types which will use this attribute. As a normal attribute is used as part of the list, any new list created automatically appears in the attributes list. 

To create a new list, choose _New list_.
