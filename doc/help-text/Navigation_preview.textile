h1. Preview navigation

To assist with visualising your navigation, you can display the navigation as it would be seen by a member of a group.

Note that this "single group" view may be too simplistic to accurately preview what your users will see. The results can be affected by:

 * Multiple groups -- users are likely to belong to more than one group, and this preview only looks at one group.
 * Permissions -- if a user does not have permission to view an object, it will not be shown to them.

This tool does take into account group membership, so if a group is a member of another group, the preview will reflect this.
