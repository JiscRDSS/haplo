h1. Types

Every object in the system has a *type*, which specifies which attributes it uses, how it's displayed, and so on.

Object types are split into two categories:

* THINGS for types which represent entities you use in your business.
* CLASSIFY for types which represent categories of descriptions used to describe the 'thing' objects. This includes the taxonomies and controlled lists.

Click on a type to show the full information about the type.

Types are hierarchical. Root types specify the general characteristics of a kind of object, and sub-types adjust this to specialise the root type. Sub-types are always a _kind of_ the root type.

To create a sub-type of a type, click on the parent type and choose _New sub-type_ from the right hand panel.

To create a new root type, choose _New root type_ from the bottom of the list of types.
