h1. Sections

Sections are used to divide the objects stored in ONEIS. They have two main roles:

* *administering permissions*: permissions are applied to Sections. What a user can do to an object (read, edit, etc) depends on which Section it is in and the user's permissions for that section. 

* *enabling search subsets*: sections divide up the objects, so you can search subsets of information.  

Keep the list as small as possible. Creating too many sections will just cause confusion as a user must choose in which section to create each object. 

When working with sections,

* Set the permissions on the section using _Groups_.
* Choose which types of object can be created in the section using _Types_.

When a user creates an object, they choose which section it is created in.

h2. Managing sections

To edit a section, choose the section in the list and click _Edit_ in the right hand panel.

To create a new section, click _New section_.
