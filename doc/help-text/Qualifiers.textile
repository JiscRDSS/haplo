h1. Qualifiers

Qualifiers are used to add detail to an attribute, for example, specifying that a title of a book is an _alternative_ title.

Each attribute specifies which qualifiers, if any, can be used with that attribute, and whether the use of that attribute affects the relevancy of the data. A qualifier can be used with any number of attributes.

A qualifier should not change the meaning of the attribute. An alternative title is still a title, and it makes sense even if you remove the qualifier.

Click on a qualifier to edit it, or choose _New qualifier_.
