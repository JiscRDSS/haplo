* _Basic information_: Name and email address, and if the user has been issued with an authentication token, the token serial number.
* _Group membership_: The groups the user belongs to.
* _Permissions_: The effective permissions for this user, taking into account all the permissions for the groups the user belongs to. Note that permissions are usually set on groups, so editing a user's permissions usually make no statement on their permissions.
* _Latest updates_: (may be renamed) Adjust the latest updates settings, including email frequency.
* _Home country_: Where the user is based, used for localising the display of information, such as telephone numbers
* _API keys_: When other software communicates with PRODUCT_NAME, it uses an API key to gain access, like a username and password. This section lists all the current keys.
