h2. Instructions

Build the manual as a wiki. Use descriptive page names with spaces, so don't use \SomeNicePage, use 'Some Nice Page' (in double square brackets) To write a word like \OpenOffice, just write it. It will be shown as a broken link on the wiki (OpenOffice), but will come out right in the help.

To mark a page as being the default page for a particular place in the system, put

FOR: /some/url

at the top. Find /some/url by looking at the address: http://test4.f/do/work/account -> /do/work/account

This page will then be displayed whenever someone clicks Help on any URL starting with /do/work/account.

If a help page is useful on more than one PRODUCT_NAME page enter multiple fors:

FOR: /some/url

FOR: /some/otherurl
