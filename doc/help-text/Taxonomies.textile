h1. Taxonomies

Taxonomies are used for hierarchical description of items. They're set up using:

* A hierarchical classification _Type_, which describes the attributes of each taxonomy term.
* A taxonomy _root object_, which has the given Type, and names the taxonomy.
* One or more _Attributes_ which use the "link to object" data type, and are set to link to objects defined by the Type.
