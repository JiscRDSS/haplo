title: hUserLabelStatements
class: HookNode
--

Allows a plugin to augment or completely rewrite the label statements which represent the permissions of a user.

Called with the SYSTEM user active, so the plugin will have a consistent view of the store and full permissions. Do not call @O.impersontate()@ when responding to this hook.
