Look up a user, and return an object implementing the [node:dev/plugin/interface/security-principal] interface.


h3(function). O.user(userId)

If a number is passed to this function, look up the user with that user ID.

An exception will be thrown if the user does not exist.


h3(function). O.user(emailAddress)

If a string is passed to this function, look up a user with that email address.

@null@ will be returned if no user has that email address.


h3(function). O.user(ref)

Look up the user with the @ref@ property set to this [node:dev/plugin/interface/ref].

@null@ will be returned if no such user exists.

If more than one user has this @ref@, your code should not rely on which one is returned.
