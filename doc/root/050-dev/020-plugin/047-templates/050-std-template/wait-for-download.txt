This template shows a progress bar while a file is being generated by a [node:dev/plugin/interface/file-transform-pipeline:file transform pipeline], then downloads the file.

The view is generated by [node:dev/plugin/interface/file-transform-pipeline#viewToWaitForOutput] and the properties it uses are subject to change.
