title: std:ui:notice
link_as: keyword
--

This template renders a generic notice, with an optional dismiss link and 'X' icon.

Use one of the @message@ or @html@ properties to specify your message.

There is also a [node:dev/plugin/templates/std-helper/ui-notice] helper, which can be more convenient.


h2. View

h3(key). message

Optional. The message, rendered using the [node:dev/plugin/templates/std-helper/text-paragraph] Handlebars helper.


h3(key). html

Optional. If the @message@ property does not render the text adequately for your purposes, for example, you'd like to include links in your text, you can use this to render arbitrary HTML inside the notice.

You should enclose your text in @<p>@ tags.


h3(key). dismissLink

Optional. If provided, this will be used as the @href@ for links to dismiss the notice, and an 'X' icon will be displayed.


h3(key). dismissText

Optional. Used as the text for an additional link at the bottom of the notice. If this is used, also include @dismissLink@.
