--

For each attribute defined in the application's schema, an entry with that attribute's API code will be defined in @SCHEMA.ATTR@.

For example, @ATTR["dc:attribute:title"]@ is the descriptor of the Title attribute.

Unlike the [node:dev/xml-http], attributes are not defined with object references in the JavaScript API. You should not rely on the values of these constants, and they may vary between applications even if the attribute is defined in exactly the same way. Always use the symbolic names.
