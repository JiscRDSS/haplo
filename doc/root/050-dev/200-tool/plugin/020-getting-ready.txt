title: Getting ready

When you start a session, you must set your PATH so that your system knows where to find the @oneis-plugin@ executable.

The exact steps depend on your platform.


h2. Windows

Using the example folders from the [node:dev/tool/plugin/install-windows:Windows installation instructions], open a @cmd@ prompt, then type:

<pre>
    set PATH=C:\oneis-development\jruby\bin;%PATH%
    cd C:\oneis-development\example-project
</pre>

Adjust the commands for the folder you chose.

You are now ready to use the Plugin Tool.


h2. Mac OS X (or other UNIX)

Using the example folders from the [node:dev/tool/plugin/install-unix:UNIX installation instructions], open a Terminal window, then type:

<pre>
    export PATH=/Users/developer/oneis-development/jruby/bin:$PATH
    cd /Users/developer/oneis-development/example-project
</pre>

Adjust the commands for the folder you chose.

You are now ready to use the Plugin Tool.
