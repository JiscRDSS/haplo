Templates have the following local vars:

	obj - object to render
	type_desc - schema type descriptor, or nil if there isn't one
	options - Hash of options
	recursion_limit - for recursively inserting other objects without potentially going for ever
	content_for_layout - _layout templates only have the content for the actual template
